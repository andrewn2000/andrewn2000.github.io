# About

Where do I start? Career? Family? Faith? The beginning or the end, or a mess of what the heck am I doing?
Since this is more of a blog, I'll just post up what I think is relevant.  I'm biased toward Microsoft technologies being ugh SQL Server Admin for most of my life.  It's become a love-hatre relationship.  Why?  Sometimes you want bigger and better than the company or provider you're working for.
My team is small and there are plenty of political changes that I feel uneasy about, but hey that's in every organization, and I'm ALWAYS right, right? ha!

So I'm starting OVER again.  You see the date I've bumped into FastAI, Jan 30, but then life took a wierd turn.
It wasn't until the release of v2 that I decided to go full swing and see if I could break out of my DBA duties.

I can't promise that I'll post all my findings as there are enough on the forums for you to dive through, but I'll comment where I think it will help.

Although somehow, I feel that github pages, recommended as the blogging platform, is a bit odd.  But go with the recommendations until I can come up with something better, so here it is.

Thanks for reading for what its worth!

Andy
