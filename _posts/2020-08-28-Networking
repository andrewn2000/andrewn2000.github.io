Before I dive into my journey, I thought I'd get a lay of the land first and reach out and make new contacts and friends.
My first thought is just plowing through the material like before, but I run into some difficulties with this.

Challenges:

1.  No accountability for anything, schedule, learning path/objectives, finding creative projects that resonate with me, etc
2.  Not sure if I'm headed in the right direction or veering off course into a tangent that wont serve me
3.  Limiting my opportunities of not getting a bigger picture

After digging through the forums, I found an interesting site at [TWIML Community](https://twimlai.com)

So I figued just getting involved here might be a better fit than the FastAI Forums.

Also, it might be good to have a checklist on things I need/want to accomplish (such as creating a Paperspace account, figuring out to publish jupyter notebooks to github, etc.

Anyhow, I also would like to be more diligent wriiting here and documenting my journey for those coming after me.
Let's see how far I get today.
